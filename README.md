## Setup

To get the system up and running, `cd` into your new repository and install all of the required Node modules:

    npm install

After that, development should be easy! Use our `dev` task to get everything up and running:

    npm run dev

Then you can hit the API at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Running on Windows

I don't own a Windows machine and I'm not enough of a masochist to try developing on one. If you need assistance, talk to [Tyrope](https://github.com/tyrope).
