## Setup

To get the system up and running just install all of the required Node modules:

    npm install -g grunt-cli node-dev
    npm install

After that, development should be easy! Use our `dev` task to get everything up and running:

    npm run dev

Then you can hit the API at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
